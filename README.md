# NestJS API with Shared Prisma Database

A modern NestJS API application that uses a shared Prisma database package for type-safe database operations and consistent data models across multiple applications.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This application follows a **shared library pattern** where:

- **`@rene-marchioretto/prisma-entities`**: Shared Prisma database package (installed as dependency)
- **`nest-api`**: NestJS API application consuming the shared database package

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **Type-safe database operations** with Prisma ORM
- ‚úÖ **Shared DTOs and entities** from the Prisma package
- ‚úÖ **Input validation** with class-validator
- ‚úÖ **API documentation** with Swagger/OpenAPI
- ‚úÖ **Environment configuration** with @nestjs/config
- ‚úÖ **Global error handling** and validation pipes
- ‚úÖ **Modular architecture** following NestJS best practices

## üìö API Documentation

Once the application is running, visit:
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:3000/api
- **API Endpoints**: http://localhost:3000
